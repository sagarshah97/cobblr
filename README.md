# COBBLR

Our proposed project is Cobblr which represents a shoe retail company. The goal of this project is to develop an online website for a shoe retail business. The website will serve as an e-commerce platform where customers can browse and purchase a wide range of shoes. The primary objective is to create an engaging and user-friendly online shopping experience that showcases the footwear collection and drives sales. Cobblr recognizes that fashion knows no bounds and seeks to create a seamless online experience for individuals of all ages and fashion preferences. The website aims to provide a curated collection of classy and trendy shoes that resonate with contemporary boys and girls who actively follow fashion trends and value expressing their individuality through their choice of footwear.
